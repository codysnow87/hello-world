# hello-world
Learning about how GitHub works
Here to discover the fantastical world of coding and computer magic.
And...moon tacos?

In my first 420 lab, we were instructed to create this hello-world tutorial. It turns out I had already created one a few years back, so I'm modifying the one already here. 

I'm a senior CS student at USM, and it feels good to type that! My first B.A. is in English, but I decided to return to school to get a B.S. in Computer Science. 60 credit hours later, here I am! 

In my non-work and non-school time (which is very limited) I love to hike, read, and work on motorcycles. 

One more update test, since I have two email accounts tied to my github account, and I want to use my school email here.
